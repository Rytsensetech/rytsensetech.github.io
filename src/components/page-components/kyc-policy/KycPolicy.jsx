                  1. It is the policy of pocketoption.com and its affiliates,
                  (hereinafter «The Company») to prohibit and actively pursue
                  the prevention of money laundering and any activity that
                  facilitates money laundering or the funding of terrorist or
                  criminal activities. The Company requires its officers,
                  employees and affiliates to adhere to these standards in
                  preventing the use of its products and services for money
                  laundering purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. For the purposes of the Policy, money laundering is
                  generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or
                  disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so
                  that the unlawful proceeds appear to have been derived from
                  legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages. Cash
                  first enters the financial system at the «placement» stage,
                  where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted
                  into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler's
                  checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions.
                  At the «layering» stage, the funds are transferred or moved
                  into other accounts or other financial institutions to further
                  separate the money from its criminal origin. At the
                  «integíndicen» stage, the funds are reintroduced into the
                  economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund
                  other criminal activities or legitimate businesses. Terrorist
                  financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct,
                  but rather an attempt to conceal the origin or intended use of
                  the funds, which will later be used for criminal purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Each employee of The Company, whose duties are associated
                  with the provision of products and services of The Company and
                  who directly or indirectly deals with the clientele of The
                  Company, is expected to know the requirements of the
                  applicable laws and regulations which affect his or her job
                  responsibilities, and it shall be the affirmative duty of such
                  employee to carry out these responsibilities at all times in a
                  manner that complies with the requirements of the relevant
                  laws and regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5. The laws and regulations include, but not limited to:
                  «Customer Due Diligence for Banks» (2001) and «General Guide
                  to Account Opening and Customer Identification» (2003) of
                  Basel Committee of banking Supervision, Forty + nine
                  Recommendations for Money Laundering of FATF, USA Patriot Act
                  (2001), Prevention and Suppression of Money Laundering
                  Activities Law of (1996).
                </p>
                <p>
                  6. To ensure that this general policy is carried out,
                  management of The Company has established and maintains an
                  ongoing program for the purpose of assuring compliance with
                  the relevant laws and regulations and the prevention of money
                  laundering. This program seeks to coordinate the specific
                  regulatory requirements throughout the group within a
                  consolidated framework in order to effectively manage the
                  group's risk of exposure to money laundering and terrorist
                  financing across all business units, functions, and legal
                  entities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  7. Each of the affiliates of The Company is required to comply
                  with AML and KYC policies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  8. All identification documentation and services records shall
                  be kept for the minimum period of time required by local law.
                </p>
                <p>
                  9. All new employees shall receive anti-money laundering
                  training as part of the mandatory new-hire training program.
                  All applicable employees are also required to complete AML and
                  KYC training annually. Participation in additional targeted
                  training programs is required for all employees with day to
                  day AML and KYC responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p>

                  provide a photograph of the Client holding the identity card
                  close to his/her face. Detailed requirements for client

                  11. The verification procedure is not mandatory for the
                  Client's identification data if the Client has not received
                  such a request from the Company. The Client may voluntarily

                  transfer, he/she must provide documents for full verification

                  immediately notify the Company’s client support department of
